CS 122A Final Project.
AD Hoc Radio Network. 
Code is from a few test cases as well as general code that needs expanding before use.
All the main.c files have been renamed to RFController.c.
TransmitBursty.c and TransmitNormal.c are programs to be run on the Raspberry PI. They are very simple and are effectively a button press, but they have been included for completeness.
